00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,792
Good Morning, Sir

3
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,750
Go to hell

4
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:34,542
Boss

5
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:40,833
"I control people's fate. They are at my mercy"

6
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:47,625
"They are delusive. I cannot totally
understand mankind"

7
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,667
"The conflicts amongst humans"

8
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,625
"Are vaster than the oceans"

9
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:56,625
"Between the good and the evil"

10
00:04:56,875 --> 00:04:59,708
"Between the good and the evil"

11
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,917
"it's hard to draw the line"

12
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,750
I was being hunted down again twice this month

13
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,958
I need a pay raise, even a little is good

14
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,375
What is it? We can't talk?

15
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,917
I...

16
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:29,583
go...

17
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,333
to watch...

18
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,542
sexy dance?

19
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,333
"Read this in a private place"

20
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,917
Listen carefully - this is
a very important mission

21
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,125
If you succeed, you...

22
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,833
can save the whole world

23
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,250
Understood

24
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,208
Dr Peterson, professor of
a university in Switzerland

25
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:24,000
had invented a seed that will
startle the universe and stir the ghosts

26
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:26,000
It's called the Seed of God

27
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,375
Bury it in sand

28
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:31,208
Sprinkle some water, and within a minute,
it will sprout and bear fruit

29
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:34,125
That sounds a bit dramatic

30
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,708
They are now taking this Seed of God

31
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:38,000
to Shenzhen to a company that
sponsored this project - Haotian Technology

32
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,292
They will give a demonstration of this
seed to the company's president - Louis Luo

33
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,250
Oh, you mean the famous Luo family that

34
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,417
has been stealing to help the poor
from generation to generation

35
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,958
Louis' father had washed his hands off
the theft business

36
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:50,292
Some said in his will,
he exhorted his five kids that

37
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:52,125
they should never steal to help the poor again

38
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:53,708
That's why his second son, Louis Luo,

39
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:57,250
started Haotian Technology
to do scientific researches

40
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,000
He is now a hugely rich man

41
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,208
I want you to get yourself into this company

42
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,750
This tablet will detonate in 10 seconds

43
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,625
You have 5 seconds left

44
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:16,333

45
44
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:17,542
<i>3</i>

46
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:18,375

47
46
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:19,417
Time's up!

48
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,375
Mom, I'm home

49
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,917
Amon, what happened to your Ninjutsu skill,
it's getting worse and worse

50
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,833
All these years of learning are a waste of time

51
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,042
You asked me to give you
a sneak attack from time to time

52
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,625
So you can upkeep your deftness

53
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,333
That's right, but there is not
a slightest improvement on your end

54
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,375
That's hardly any challenge to me?

55
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,792
Can't you feel a little breeze
coming from behind?

56
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,625
Funny I do feel a breeze now
that you mentioned it

57
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,500
Why?

58
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,917
Aren't we great buddies,
we have the same taste for underpants

59
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,292
How is that possible?

60
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,542
My size is obviously bigger than yours

61
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:34,250
Louis

62
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,042
You didn't get hurt, did you?

63
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:38,625
What do you think?

64
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,667
Let me rub it for you

65
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,375
Louis, I'm a big girl now,

66
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,542
you can't rub for me

67
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,958
You're right

68
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,583
I'm a big boy too, you can't rub for me either

69
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,875
Are you out of your mind?

70
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:50,000
I could have hurt Ka-yan.
How could you do that?

71
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,000
Louis

72
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,792
But I am the descendent
of the famous Luo family

73
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:54,958
I have to master my fighting skills too

74
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:57,292
I can't ruin our family name
traveling in the world

75
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,875
You think you can travel the world
with that pathetic kung-fu skills of yours

76
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:01,375
What shall I tell Mom
if anything happens to you?

77
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,333
What do you want to tell me?

78
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:06,042
- Mom
- Come,Baby

79
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,250
Mom

80
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,500
Why are you still up at this hour?

81
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,833
I have to make sure you drink the soup.
I know you won't otherwise

82
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,833
This soup is really nourishing

83
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,833
Yes, it's good for your lungs

84
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,458
Drink it while it's still hot

85
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,667
Dementia is really getting
to her head these days

86
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,292
Yesterday, she mistook me for her dog

87
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,417
Meatball

88
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,292
Come on, drink it while it's hot

89
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:33,750
It's good for you

90
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,958
Just drink it

91
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,833
It's for your own good

92
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:43,125
Son, it's really flavorful. Isn't it?

93
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,500
It can't get any fresher than this

94
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,417
You guys chat. I'm sleepy

95
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,875
Mom, you should go to bed

96
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,333
Mom, be careful

97
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,917
Oh, Meatball has been such a good boy today

98
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,000
He hasn't made a sound all day

99
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,708
That's right. He's always been good

100
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,625
Son, I was just going over some old stuff

101
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,292
And I came across this secret book
of martial arts that your father wrote

102
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,000
The Art of Breaking Free

103
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,583
I have learnt it before

104
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,000
Shall I teach you now?

105
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,000
Sure

106
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:28,750
"Teddyboy"

107
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,458
Mom, on second thoughts,
I guess I had better practise by myself later

108
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,292
Oh

109
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,292
You can't handle it on your own

110
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,292
I have to help you

111
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,542
HOW?

112
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,667
Like this

113
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,875
So now you figure it out yourself

114
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,833
And within 6 hours

115
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:45,917
You will get the hang of it

116
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,500
And you will be able to break free

117
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,708
Understand?

118
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,667
I understand, Mom

119
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,208
Good boy

120
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:00,417
Ka-yan, untie me! Quick!

121
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,708
Mom wants you to practise on your own.
You should work on it

122
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,417
I dare not do anything against her will

123
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:06,625
Amon

124
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,000
Amon, help!

125
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:08,833
Amon

126
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,000
Help me, Amon

127
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,917
I thought

128
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,750
You love this kind of stuff

129
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,292
I will cut your pay!

130
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,333
You traitor!

131
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,042
I will cut your pay!

132
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,917
Don't turn the lights off!

133
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,417
I'm afraid of the dark!

134
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:25,500
Help!

135
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:36,750
Good morning, Mr Luo

136
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:02,792
Good morning, President Luo

137
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,000
Good morning, President Luo

138
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,708
Louis, looks like your company has
a lot of good-looking staff

139
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,417
Even the janitor is so handsome!

140
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,458
Today, there will be a professor
from Switzerland

141
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:49,833
coming to demonstrate a magical seed

142
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,250
Its value is phenomenal

143
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,583
Sol...

144
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,250
Mr Luo, Mr Stephen Stone
and Dr Peterson have arrived

145
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,958
- Mr Luo, it's been a while
- Yes, it's been a while

146
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,917
Thank you for working so hard on
this research, Dr Peterson

147
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,167
Finally, we meet in person

148
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,958
The Seed of God - just add water,

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,125
and it will grow into any
kind of crop in no time

150
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,667
If this really works out,

151
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,708
that means all the famine
in poor countries will be solved?

152
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,292
Because its outcome is so spectacular,

153
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,917
I have decided to give you
a demonstration in person today

154
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,667
This is just sand. How can it grow anything?

155
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:51,292
That is the marvel of it

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,125
Unbelievable

157
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,083
This is a miracle

158
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:21,875
Is it edible?

159
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,917
Definitely. Try it

160
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,208
It does taste and smell sweet, doesn't it?

161
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,750
In other words, we can even
grow apples in a desert

162
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,750
Just add water, and you can grow anything

163
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,250
This Seed of God will undoubtedly put
an end to famine

164
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,292
But on the other hand,

165
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,667
it will also drive a lot of
agricultural countries to brankruptcy

166
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,042
Stop

167
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:56,458
There is a meeting going on inside

168
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,875
You cannot enter

169
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,292
Attack

170
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,458
Don't make a move

171
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,125
This is the latest technology - sonic gun.
We are not her match

172
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,167
Take him with us

173
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,833
We're done. Come over now

174
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,958
What the hell is that?

175
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,875
You...

176
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,125
Professor

177
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:24,542
Come with us if you want to live

178
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:30,333
Let's go

179
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:42,333
Aren't you the handsome janitor
outside the toilet?

180
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:44,333
Hey, be polite

181
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,375
Louis Luo

182
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:00,458
lam...

183
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,500
I know who you are

184
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:02,333
Sir Sampan

185
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,292
Agent code 119

186
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:05,458
You are the agent that
caused the most trouble in the Interpol

187
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,458
Last year, for trying to catch a thief
that snatched a handbag

188
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,958
You wrecked 103 cars

189
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,000
plus a motorboat and an airplane

190
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,708
I see Interpol is on the case now

191
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:17,000
No wonder the press
hasn't mentioned anything about it

192
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,083
That's right

193
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,750
Because we don't want to arouse any panic

194
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,625
We hope to retrieve the Seed of God
in the shortest time possible

195
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,833
Shouldn't you be somewhere looking for it now?

196
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:25,667
Why are you in my house?

197
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,458
I want you to work with me

198
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,375
I'm just a normal civilian. How can I help you?

199
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,542
No...

200
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,042
Louis Luo

201
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,125
I know who you are

202
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,750
For the past 30+ generations,
the whole Luo family have been thieves

203
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:40,708
We were robinhoods

204
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,458
And we have quit long time ago

205
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,833
Honey

206
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:46,667
Who are you?

207
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,750
Who are you?

208
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,917
Mom...

209
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:49,833
Good girl...

210
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:50,875
Come here...

211
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,125
Who are you, young lady?

212
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,875
You just love joking around

213
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,833
Amnesia and other bullshit

214
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,625
You don't remember me?

215
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,458
You don't have to explain...

216
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,833
I'm just happy you're back

217
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,250
I made soup, I'll get you the soup

218
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,250
Mom...

219
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,750
The good soup should be served to...

220
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,292
Dad

221
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,167
That's right

222
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,000
You wait here

223
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
<i>Okay</i>

224
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,708
- Who is that?
- My mom

225
00:20:19,958 --> 00:20:21,250
She has a little bit of Dementia

226
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,708
She always mixes up people and things

227
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,167
Okay, I am happy to play along with that

228
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:29,167
Mind if we talk in private?

229
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,542
We have nothing to talk about

230
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,292
The Interpol has a strong team of great agents

231
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:38,500
Why am I needed?

232
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,167
The story is...

233
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,833
That our computer system has been hacked

234
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,917
All the Interpol agents' IDs have been leaked

235
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,958
I need your help

236
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,792
I appreciate that thought

237
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:56,917
But I'm still not gonna help you

238
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,667
The Seed-of-God project was sponsored by you

239
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:05,292
And it was ultimately being
robbed in your company

240
00:21:05,542 --> 00:21:07,125
You cannot evade accountability

241
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,375
I know who took the Seed of God

242
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,417
A Japanese Criminal Organization
called Crescent,

243
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,958
headed by a woman named Snow

244
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,792
But there is one thing you are not aware of

245
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,958
The professor was not abducted

246
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,750
He is an accomplice that
led them to rob the Seed of God

247
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:26,083
Then they will sell the seeds to
the biggest criminal syndicate

248
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,208
K-MAX

249
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,250
Just think about this

250
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,417
If the Seed of God falls into
the hands of K-MAX, what will happen?

251
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,750
There is no time for hesitation.
Let's have a contest

252
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,333
If you lose, you come with me

253
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:49,875
This is my phone

254
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,083
I put it here in this pocket

255
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,417
If you can get it within a minute, I lose

256
00:21:54,667 --> 00:21:56,583
No...

257
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:04,167
I put the phone here

258
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:05,958
If you can get it within a minute,

259
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:06,958
I lose

260
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:07,958
Come on

261
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:13,875
Come on

262
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,333
Meatball, come here

263
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:23,250
You're bad

264
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:26,625
So, I win?

265
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,792
That doesn't count

266
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:29,917
You didn't steal it, he did!

267
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,083
I will give you another chance.
I've been wanting to hit you all along

268
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:38,250
Now if you managed to hit my face

269
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,625
I lose

270
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:40,792
Come on

271
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:53,417
Fighting your dad is my job

272
00:22:53,833 --> 00:22:56,292
He always loses to me

273
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,833
She didn't get to touch my face

274
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,375
That doesn't count

275
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,417
Let's race cars

276
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,000
There is an 8 curve somewhere ahead

277
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,208
After this 8 curve, there is a sharp curve

278
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:25,708
After the sharp curve, at around 200 meters,
there is a road sign

279
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,458
Whoever passes the road sign first
is the winner

280
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,292
You have already lost 2 rounds.
I hope this time you will win

281
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:37,042
I need a good working partner

282
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,958
Let's do this

283
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,292
As long as you win this round

284
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:42,250
I will consider helping you

285
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:37,833
Doctor, how is Sampan Hung's condition?

286
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,125
Not optimistic. I'm afraid you can't all go in

287
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,458
You wait here

288
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,083
You are...

289
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,208
I'm Sir Sampan's colleague

290
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,458
My name is Bing Bing.
I'm from the Weapons Unit

291
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,042
Bing Bing?

292
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,000
I hope your last name is not Lee

293
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,625
My last name is Fan

294
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,458
Hello, I'm doing something important here

295
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,792
Let's talk later

296
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,583
Miss Fan Bing Bing

297
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,292
Now...

298
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:30,833
No

299
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:32,708
Mr Fan

300
00:26:33,208 --> 00:26:34,167
How is his condition now?

301
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,500
Sir Sampan...

302
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,667
I'm sorry

303
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:50,708
I ruined your car

304
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,833
The car is minor. Your well-being
is more important

305
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:01,042
I am a failed agent

306
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:04,625
I'm not as competent as you

307
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,333
I am ashamed of myself

308
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,250
What can I do for you?

309
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,500
I wished...

310
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:14,292
You could save the earth

311
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,458
The Seed of God

312
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,208
Get it back

313
00:27:21,417 --> 00:27:24,625
This is my final wish

314
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:26,958
Sir Sampan...

315
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,250
I will think about it

316
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:32,167
You shouldn't have to think

317
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,500
If you don't promise me

318
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,125
I will...

319
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:41,375
turn in my grave

320
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,625
Sir Sampan

321
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,083
I said I would think about it

322
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,833
Sir Sampan

323
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,875
I will try my best

324
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,958
I will do it

325
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,542
Sir Sampan

326
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:29,583
My condolences

327
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,500
Louis, how is he?

328
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,792
Gone

329
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:53,333
I have to make a call to help
with his funeral arrangements

330
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,333
My phone is still in the room

331
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,958
You were over-acting, did you know that?

332
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:24,875
It's not easy to play sissy!

333
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,500
Is it really that bad?

334
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,500
Nothing. I came back for my cell phone

335
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,000
You guys go ahead

336
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:41,042
Don't come near me

337
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:42,667
If you come near, I will squash
you with my finger

338
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,292
Squash you

339
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,417
I will squash you

340
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:54,500
This is our special agents' training centre

341
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,167
What kind of kung fu is that?

342
00:30:00,417 --> 00:30:02,042
They are just fooling around

343
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:17,833
Is this also just fooling around?

344
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,500
No. They screwed up

345
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,417
Bing Bing

346
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:30,250
Bing Bing

347
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,000
Sir Sampan

348
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,958
Did you say you have some new invention for me?

349
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,458
Just in time. I have just invented
a new cell phone

350
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,500
If it comes to cell phones,

351
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,417
the latest should be
from our company - uPhone 8s

352
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,625
Plus

353
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:41,792
You can have one each

354
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:42,833
I don't want your phone

355
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,833
This is from our Weapons' Unit

356
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,667
We spent 3 years working on it

357
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,750
It has 207 special functions

358
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,750
It's called Phon-omenal Phone!

359
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,292
Our uPhone 8s Plus

360
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,917
Has 707 special functions

361
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,083
707 eh? Does it shoot fire?

362
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:03,583
You made it!

363
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,500
Impressive, eh?

364
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,458
With a pirate charger,

365
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:10,708
not only will it shoot fire,
it will blow up too

366
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,000
This is a very dangerous weapon

367
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,542
When in danger, it can even
shoot out shock needles

368
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,708
You mean this?

369
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:28,083
Sir Sampan. What are you doing?

370
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,458
Making a call

371
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,292
I forgot to tell you

372
00:31:31,292 --> 00:31:32,458
Our Phonomenal Phone...

373
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,667
has 207 special functions,

374
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:35,625
but one function is missing...

375
00:31:35,792 --> 00:31:37,292
the call function

376
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:39,875
So it's a phone that cannot make calls

377
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,500
How can you miss that?

378
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
It's truly phenomenal!

379
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:45,958
How can you miss that?

380
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:46,667
Sir Sampan, don't hit me

381
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:47,667
How could you miss that?

382
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,792
Don't...

383
00:31:50,792 --> 00:31:52,875
Sir Sampan, we found Iron Hawk

384
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,708
Macau Customs has verified
that Iron Hawk has arrived

385
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,458
Iron Hawk is Sir Condor's right-hand guy

386
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,958
He is usually active around
Cambodia and Thailand

387
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,667
His mission this time,

388
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:11,542
must have something to do with their business
with the Crescent in Macau

389
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:13,458
How did you get your hands on
such inside information?

390
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:15,417
We have an undercover working for them

391
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,625
But I don't know who he is

392
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,125
So let's go to Macau

393
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:21,000
Ask Tina to make arrangements for us

394
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:49,458
1 million dollars

395
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,417
The banker has won 2 times in a row

396
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:51,750
You should bet on the banker

397
00:32:54,583 --> 00:32:56,000
Minors should not be playing cards

398
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:57,042
Let me do it

399
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:02,792
Kiddo, be careful not to lose
your underpants on the betting table

400
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,417
Face card...

401
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,083
It's a 9 or 10

402
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,417
You're dead

403
00:33:34,375 --> 00:33:37,458
9 or 10...

404
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,125
Face card...

405
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,958
I can play with my eyes shut,
and still win over you

406
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,083
TV set...

407
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,875
Cute, eh?

408
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,208
That's impossible

409
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,333
I have corners

410
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,208
There...

411
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,333
Banker scores 0, Player scores 1

412
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:26,083
Player wins

413
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:30,667
Hey, don't go

414
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:31,958
- Don't mess around
- I can lend you some chips

415
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:33,500
You had better go now

416
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,083
I will donate your winnings to charity

417
00:34:38,417 --> 00:34:40,208
This kid is rebellious. Let me deal with her

418
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:42,542
Go get changed for dinner

419
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:43,667
<i>Okay</i>

420
00:34:52,042 --> 00:34:52,667
You...

421
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:53,667
What are you doing?

422
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:54,458
No...

423
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:57,250
You dared provoke me?

424
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,083
I will show you...

425
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:03,625
Amon

426
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,792
Louis

427
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,583
Ka-yan maybe in danger

428
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:08,625
Go check on her

429
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:09,667
Yes

430
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,458
Wait here

431
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:44,125
You should work on your punches? Try mine

432
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,042
Can you not see?

433
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,875
Wanna play bullfighting?

434
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,167
Come on...

435
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,792
Ouch...

436
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,125
Why are you taking pictures?

437
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,000
Why not?

438
00:36:44,417 --> 00:36:45,750
Jedi

439
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:57,542
Ouch...

440
00:36:59,292 --> 00:37:02,083
Ouch...

441
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:15,542
You used sleeping gas?

442
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:17,500
Well, you started it

443
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:25,958
Who are you?

444
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:26,875
Your father

445
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,833
Then I'm your mother

446
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,250
You think that's funny?

447
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,500
Louis. Is Ka-yan okay?

448
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,042
Where are my spare glasses?

449
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,250
What's going on?

450
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:57,583
Let go of her!

451
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:03,583
You alright?

452
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,417
If I call her

453
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:35,625
I wonder if she will take it

454
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,667
Sir Sampan, Louis has gone missing

455
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,333
Don't panic, I will find him

456
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,000
Anybody?

457
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,500
Anybody still alive?

458
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,708
I'm alive

459
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:36,917
Nobody has visited this place for a week

460
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,500
It's under renovation

461
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,333
Nobody will come to save you

462
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,375
Why don't you chase me

463
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:50,417
Little Chump!

464
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,125
Louis Luo

465
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:54,042
Why did you stick your nose into our business?

466
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,125
There are quite some people working with him

467
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,125
I will kill you right now

468
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,000
Wait a minute

469
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:05,583
This is from South America

470
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,417
A venomous bug found at the banks of the Amazon
with super reproductive power

471
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,875
These parasites love living in the body
of their host animal

472
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,583
They will lay eggs in a few hours

473
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,750
The eggs will turn into bugs

474
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,875
And suck up all the nutrients of the host

475
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,417
Then bite their way out of the host's body

476
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:24,583
And look for the next host

477
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,167
This is the law of nature

478
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,500
They look like chilly crayfish

479
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,375
Phoenix, Ape...

480
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:44,083
yank his mouth open

481
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,667
This bug is afraid of coldness

482
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,667
It will crawl to the warmest places

483
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,083
There are spikes on its legs

484
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:05,042
You can't spit them out

485
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,917
Wait till you die, and your body gets cold

486
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,750
Then it will bite through your body to get out

487
00:41:10,125 --> 00:41:13,292
You women are so vicious

488
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:15,833
Okay, I should go now

489
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,042
Hey

490
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:19,208
Sir Condor is waiting for you
at the usual place

491
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,042
Well then, let's all leave

492
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:26,125
The sight of blood always gives me the chills.
I might pass out

493
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,375
I need to get my body warmer

494
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,667
You need to cool down
and let your body temperature drop

495
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,458
What are you doing?

496
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:19,000
Why did you save me?

497
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,583
Who are you?

498
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:25,083
Come back here

499
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,375
Phoenix!

500
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:28,458
Why did you save me?

501
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,583
Who are you?

502
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:32,708
Phoenix!

503
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,917
There he is

504
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,875
You Okay?

505
00:43:44,875 --> 00:43:46,083
- Louis
- I'm okay

506
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:46,792
Let me do it

507
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,167
Good thing the tracker was activated

508
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:02,958
Let me do it

509
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,792
I almost got eaten up by his bug

510
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,875
Fortunately the girl with silvery hair
in the Crescent gang

511
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:15,167
The one that's called Phoenix, she saved me

512
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,708
She's also using this Phonomenal Phone

513
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,542
She can't be your people, can she?

514
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:22,125
It's possible

515
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:25,500
Milan!

516
00:44:39,792 --> 00:44:42,292
This information is passed to me
by the Italian secret service

517
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:44,250
I can't read Italian

518
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:46,500
Who can read Italian?

519
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:50,625
Thanks

520
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:00,917
Speak Cantonese!

521
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,458
They said Crescent has a secret lab in Milan

522
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:06,708
Its security system is guaranteed No. 1
in the whole of Europe

523
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,125
It's full of dangerous traps

524
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,375
The stuff we are looking for
is definitely inside

525
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:12,500
They don't know about the Seed of God?

526
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,375
No, they don't

527
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:15,667
What we know is that

528
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:18,250
Condor has already left Eastern Europe

529
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,000
He will probably meet up
with Crescent these few days

530
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,375
Tell me about the security system of the lab

531
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,667
Tell me everything

532
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,292
- Yes
- I want every detail

533
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:34,750
This is the maximum security laboratory that
we have spent 18 months building

534
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,708
Without this card and my iris,

535
00:45:36,708 --> 00:45:38,917
not even a fly can get in

536
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:45,542
Let me remind you

537
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,125
After this door is opened,

538
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,583
please hold your breath

539
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:49,875
and walk quietly

540
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:52,750
Any sound exceeding 25 decibels
along this hallway,

541
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,458
will trigger off the revolving laser blades

542
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:57,500
Intruders will be cut up like ground meat

543
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,583
Are you serious?

544
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,500
The laser blades run on the X and Y-axes.
It's vertically covered all around

545
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:13,333
Not even a mosquito can get away

546
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:16,625
Don't worry

547
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,750
The Seed of God is very safe in here

548
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,083
25 decibels

549
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,042
Revolving laser blades

550
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:12,042
That's good

551
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,417
Dr Peterson, shall we talk business now?

552
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:16,583
I thought we have already settled our business

553
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,167
We sell them and you get 30% of the money

554
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:22,542
We wish to sell them together
with the formula that only you know

555
00:47:22,542 --> 00:47:23,875
That way the profit can be much higher

556
00:47:23,917 --> 00:47:24,750
You can't do that

557
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,458
If that doesn't work, then we get 70%,

558
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:28,750
and you get 30%

559
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:29,875
Definitely not

560
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,750
Imagine we stop protecting you,

561
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,708
once you step out of this laboratory...

562
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:36,167
Condor and his men will get you
and torture you to death

563
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,417
How can you do business like this?

564
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,917
Who will want to work with people
like you anymore?

565
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,042
Do you think...

566
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:44,667
you have the chance to tell that to anyone?

567
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:49,208
What are you going to do?

568
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,500
This is the latest invention

569
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,167
In 72 hours,

570
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:56,042
it will make a copy of all your memories

571
00:47:56,917 --> 00:47:58,125
How does it do that?

572
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:19,542
Sir Condor

573
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,083
According to my reliable sources

574
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,917
Snow has already killed Dr Peterson

575
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,375
However, they have duplicated all his memory

576
00:48:32,625 --> 00:48:35,042
Along with the secret of the Seed of God

577
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,667
If we use the Seed of God
on the cultivation of cocaine

578
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:43,083
Our annual profit will grow at least ten-fold

579
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,542
- That's right
- I have already set up a meeting

580
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:50,542
for you two to meet Snow
at the San Siro Stadium

581
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,583
Impressive

582
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:59,417
I can't believe this little girl can actually
do better than a hacker

583
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:00,792
She's always been a hacker

584
00:49:00,792 --> 00:49:02,667
Only that we can't tell from her face

585
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:06,125
That's right

586
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,208
If we want to get into the lab,

587
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,708
that means,

588
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:12,375
we have to duplicate the key to
the manager Sophia's house...

589
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,375
and also the image of her iris

590
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,708
Why do we need the image of her iris?

591
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,125
Because the image of the iris works
like a fingerprint

592
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:22,542
Everybody's iris image is unique

593
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,292
Sophia has been in Milan for 8 years,

594
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,750
but she hasn't had a boyfriend
in the past 7 years

595
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,167
She is extremely lonely

596
00:49:31,625 --> 00:49:33,333
Then what is her taste in men like?

597
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:36,250
She likes men that wear trench coats

598
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,625
Her ex had been forced
to wear a trenchcoat day in day out

599
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:43,292
Sophia has been a super fan
of Alain Delon since childhood

600
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:47,167
That's why she is infatuated with men
that wears trench coats

601
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:49,875
Speaking of eccentricities

602
00:49:50,833 --> 00:49:52,083
If...

603
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,458
we want to get...

604
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,542
the image of her iris,

605
00:49:55,708 --> 00:49:59,958
we will need to find a man that
loves wearing trenchcoats

606
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,625
She is also in favour of men that...

607
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:03,250
are handsome,

608
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,708
has musical sense,

609
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:06,958
loving...

610
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:08,958
Where can we find such a perfect man?

611
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:10,250
Why are you cracking up?

612
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
He is totally referring to me

613
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,417
I have to conquer her

614
00:50:55,292 --> 00:50:56,750
I...

615
00:50:57,583 --> 00:50:59,208
love...

616
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:08,125
And so I got her eyeballs

617
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:11,542
If you like doing that, then you should go

618
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:12,792
Of course I should go

619
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:13,792
You don't think you are qualified
for that mission, do you?

620
00:51:13,792 --> 00:51:15,625
Handsome, trenchcoat...

621
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:18,083
"New message"

622
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,375
"Our spy in the Crescent is called Phoenix"

623
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,625
"Contact her if you need to"

624
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:37,000
It's late

625
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,333
You didn't ask me to come here
just to have coffee with you, right?

626
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,667
What is it?

627
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,417
In the past 5 to 6 days

628
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:49,042
I keep wanting to ask you this question

629
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,792
Shoot

630
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:54,917
Phoenix, the girl with silvery hair,

631
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:57,792
is she an undercover from your side?

632
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,583
Undercover is a highly confidential topic.
How can I tell you?

633
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,083
If not,

634
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:07,083
why did she take such risk to save my life?

635
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,542
She sucked the bug out for me

636
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,917
Tell me, are you in love with her?

637
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:15,958
You tell me first. Is she your undercover?

638
00:52:18,875 --> 00:52:20,458
Seriously?

639
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:25,417
I'm not telling you

640
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,000
You suck

641
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,167
Don't ask again

642
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:33,958
Even if you do, I won't tell you

643
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,458
Be serious,

644
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,333
do you know Phoenix?

645
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,792
You look smart and trendy,

646
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,250
but why are you so dumb when it comes to love?

647
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,458
I have always been dumb

648
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,208
You look like you know a lot about love

649
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,750
Let's change the subject

650
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:53,583
I don't want to change it

651
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:55,958
Tell me frankly

652
00:52:56,292 --> 00:52:57,875
Do you have a girlfriend?

653
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,417
- No
- Then do you have a boyfriend?

654
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,125
Are you looking for some spanking?

655
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
<i>Okay</i>

656
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:08,125
<i>I'll</i> tell <i>you</i>

657
00:53:09,875 --> 00:53:11,792
In fact, when it comes to love,

658
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:14,917
I am just as dumb

659
00:53:17,792 --> 00:53:19,250
I had a wife

660
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,083
Divorced

661
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,833
Two years now. We've been divorced for 2 years

662
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,000
She said...

663
00:53:34,708 --> 00:53:36,208
everyday she was afraid...

664
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,875
that I wouldn't come home after I left

665
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,917
Then, even if her husband had
any big accomplishments,

666
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:44,042
she couldn't tell anyone that...

667
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,292
her husband had saved the world

668
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:50,583
She can't even tell anyone what
her husband does for a job

669
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,000
If you change your job,

670
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,583
then may be she will come back to you

671
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,542
Being a secret agent for so long

672
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:00,792
I have made a lot of enemies

673
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:03,500
If I quit now, maybe I will die even sooner

674
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,958
I'm afraid...

675
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:08,625
she will suffer

676
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:14,583
I have a feeling you have a very good wife

677
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,333
Do you have a picture of her?

678
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,208
Not bad

679
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:30,542
Very pretty

680
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,375
She looks like a loving wife

681
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:34,125
You two look good together

682
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:37,000
This is the only one I have left

683
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,292
I'll bet you

684
00:54:39,917 --> 00:54:41,583
That she will come back to you

685
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,417
Thanks

686
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,875
It's nice hanging out with you

687
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:55,917
I've been losing to you all along

688
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,542
Let's have another contest

689
00:54:57,917 --> 00:54:59,667
See who reaches the hotel first

690
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:00,750
If you lose,

691
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,833
you buy me a 1982 red wine

692
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:05,292
If I lose, I buy you a 2012

693
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:09,708
Sounds like I'm having big advantage

694
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:13,375
You've smartened up

695
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:18,292
Phoenix is our undercover

696
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:22,333
The contest has started

697
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:24,250
You're bad

698
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,458
I can't imagine you can
go out of your way for love

699
00:55:32,458 --> 00:55:34,583
So much that you would just let me win

700
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,042
You are a bad person

701
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,083
You are not much better than me

702
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,917
But I am really happy to be acquainted with you

703
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:43,500
We should celebrate

704
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:45,208
Let me order a bottle of champagne

705
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:47,583
Good. I haven't got trashed for a long time

706
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,042
That's fast

707
00:55:54,208 --> 00:55:55,625
That can't be it

708
00:55:55,958 --> 00:55:56,875
I haven't even made the call

709
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,750
- Hi
- Good evening. Room Service

710
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,875
That's quick

711
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,083
Yes. It's from the hotel

712
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:02,750
Good

713
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,625
Enjoy, Sir

714
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,500
Thank you

715
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:09,875
The service here is too impressive

716
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,917
Don't you dare hit me

717
00:57:52,792 --> 00:57:54,167
That's another assassin from K-MAX

718
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,708
Who would have predicted...

719
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:03,375
that I would end up being injured like this

720
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:05,583
The day after tomorrow is
the Finals for AC Milan

721
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,625
All eyes will be on the match

722
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:10,625
This is the best time to make a move

723
00:58:11,208 --> 00:58:13,042
But your condition is quite bad

724
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,458
Who can we send to seduce Sophia?

725
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:19,125
You're right about that

726
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,625
In fact, you look quite handsome too

727
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,583
Me...

728
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,542
Are you alright?

729
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,458
This is incredible

730
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,417
I dreamt about exactly the same scene

731
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,000
It's been more than a month

732
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:23,750
You were in my dreams

733
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,667
You have appeared in my dreams
for more than a month

734
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,833
OMG!

735
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,042
Why is this happening?

736
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:32,125
What did you see in your dreams?

737
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,167
I dreamt I was dying

738
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,417
I dreamt of you

739
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,333
I dreamt of this place

740
00:59:39,958 --> 00:59:41,500
I dreamt of you and I together

741
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:43,750
The two of us...

742
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,292
We were doing...

743
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,042
I'm ashamed to say it

744
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,458
Say it please

745
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:52,875
I'm...

746
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,208
I'm too embarrassed to talk about it

747
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,083
Tell me

748
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:58,042
I'm...

749
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:00,708
Let's find a softer piece of ground to talk

750
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,375
Okay!

751
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:03,375
Let's go

752
01:00:06,083 --> 01:00:08,667
I haven't touched a man in 7 years

753
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,458
You...

754
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:13,125
are a gift from heaven to me

755
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,458
No

756
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,542
I can't violate my goddess

757
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,542
I wished I was dead

758
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:22,125
Stay down for a while

759
01:00:23,292 --> 01:00:24,542
In fact...

760
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,500
I've always wanted to do what
we did in my dreams

761
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,375
But...

762
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:33,708
it is hard to say it out loud

763
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,958
Do it...

764
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:39,625
Let me dim the lights

765
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,833
You're so romantic

766
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:43,750
Go now

767
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,292
Get down

768
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:55,042
Can you guess what I did to you in my dreams?

769
01:00:55,417 --> 01:00:57,792
I don't know

770
01:00:57,875 --> 01:00:59,500
In my dreams,

771
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,167
I kissed your feet

772
01:01:03,833 --> 01:01:05,500
This is so original

773
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:15,458
Baby...

774
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:16,833
Do it...

775
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,083
Why is your eye blue?

776
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:34,750
I am wearing coloured Contact lens. Like it?

777
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:35,958
Yes. I like it

778
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:38,833
Vodka

779
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,708
Not spicy enough, have to add some chili sauce

780
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,500
Baby...

781
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:54,542
Use...

782
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,625
your mouth...

783
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:56,542
to feed...

784
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:57,583
me

785
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:59,125
Do it

786
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:04,542
I'm sorry

787
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:06,458
Are you alright?

788
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:07,625
I'm alright

789
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,125
Let me go clean up

790
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,458
- Clean up...
- You wait here

791
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:14,458
I wait here...

792
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:37,792
Come on

793
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:51,667
I can't relax with the lights on

794
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,417
Put them out

795
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,083
Run

796
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,083
I miss my wife

797
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,875
Okay. <i>I'll</i> call her

798
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:42,708
Sir Sampan, I'm all set

799
01:03:42,708 --> 01:03:44,292
How's it going on your end?

800
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:45,833
I'm ready

801
01:03:46,125 --> 01:03:47,042
Tell Louis,

802
01:03:47,917 --> 01:03:50,458
there are 282 units of laser beams
in the security system,

803
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:54,083
with 0.25 meter's distance between them

804
01:03:54,625 --> 01:03:57,000
There are 8 laser beam combinations

805
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,792
The last one to activate is based on
Descartes' rule of signs

806
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,375
So if they don't leave within <i>3</i> minutes

807
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:04,208
They are dead

808
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:06,792
But,

809
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,708
with your brother's skills,
that shouldn't be a problem

810
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,750
- Don't worry
- Sir Sampan, thank you

811
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:13,750
You're welcome

812
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,167
It's good to have family

813
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:44,458
5 billion

814
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:45,458
<i>3</i> billion

815
01:04:45,875 --> 01:04:46,417
No

816
01:04:46,417 --> 01:04:48,583
No deal then

817
01:04:50,667 --> 01:04:52,750
"Iron Hawk: I'm inside the lab"

818
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:06,917
"Sir Sampan: Get to the lab at once"

819
01:05:14,208 --> 01:05:15,792
Where is he?

820
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,750
- Hello
- Has your brother arrived?

821
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:26,417
- Not yet
- We have to hurry. We are running out of time

822
01:05:27,292 --> 01:05:28,375
Louis is here

823
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:30,583
How's it going?

824
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,417
Sir Sampan has familiarized himself
with the security system

825
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:33,542
Then we should move fast

826
01:05:33,542 --> 01:05:34,458
<i>Okay</i>

827
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:36,875
Once the laser blades have been activated,

828
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,708
you must evacuate within 3 minutes

829
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:40,500
Or your live will be at risk

830
01:05:47,875 --> 01:05:49,625
The range is about 52 meters

831
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:50,542
I weigh 70 kg

832
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,250
Louis, be careful

833
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:00,458
Let's do it

834
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:35,833
It's you again?

835
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:52,958
You shouldn't have to save him

836
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,917
He's a life after all

837
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,208
Mr Luo

838
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,000
You are a good man

839
01:10:05,042 --> 01:10:05,667
Thank you

840
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,542
You're blinded again

841
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,750
The needles are poisonous

842
01:10:33,417 --> 01:10:34,917
Since last time

843
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:36,625
I have learnt my lesson
and got lasik surgery done

844
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:37,708
I wore glasses to fool you

845
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,500
You cheater

846
01:10:41,125 --> 01:10:43,250
Haven't I told you?

847
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,583
I'll find a way to neutralise the poison in you

848
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,250
I can still hang on for a while

849
01:10:47,375 --> 01:10:48,833
We'd better get the Seed of God now

850
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:07,167
This is the doctor's memory drive

851
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:08,958
Let's go

852
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:23,292
What do you want?

853
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,083
What are you doing?

854
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:40,542
I am warming up my body
to suck out the bug inside you

855
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,417
I didn't eat any bug

856
01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:47,625
That's right

857
01:11:53,417 --> 01:11:54,625
Don't suck

858
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,292
Don't suck

859
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:59,667
You did it for me once

860
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,708
Louis, what are you doing?

861
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:27,083
What are you laughing about?
Never seen a handsome man?

862
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:30,083
Mom, I'm back in town

863
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,208
Then why don't you come home?

864
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:34,125
I have something important
to hand over to the police

865
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:35,667
I'll come home right after that

866
01:12:36,167 --> 01:12:37,292
I made soup

867
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,417
Come back to drink it

868
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:42,667
It's ginseng with bird's nest,
banana and meat buns soup. It's good

869
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,833
Ka-yan and Amon will be home before me

870
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,583
Why don't you serve them first?

871
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:52,875
Mr KK wants to meet you now,
so he can praise you in person

872
01:12:57,750 --> 01:12:59,250
You are a hero

873
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,500
You are a hero

874
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,750
You are a big hero

875
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,708
Try "super"

876
01:13:03,708 --> 01:13:04,833
Super

877
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:07,417
I know

878
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,417
I think "big" can better express

879
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:12,167
The respect I have for him now

880
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:13,292
Right

881
01:13:13,292 --> 01:13:14,250
Big

882
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:15,917
And handsome

883
01:13:15,917 --> 01:13:17,167
More handsome than you and me

884
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:18,000
I don't know about that

885
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
If we go back 20 years,

886
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'm sure Sir Sampan was
a top-notch handsome man

887
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,042
You're too nice

888
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:24,958
Well, at least he had been handsome once

889
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,292
A supermarket coupon of $588

890
01:13:35,042 --> 01:13:36,083
It's very practical

891
01:13:36,708 --> 01:13:37,583
Thank you

892
01:13:37,583 --> 01:13:39,000
If there's nothing else, I shall go now

893
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,875
Don't

894
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,208
Please sit...

895
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:44,417
I still have a lot of compliments for you

896
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,875
Sit

897
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:47,958
Boss

898
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,875
You have been speaking for 90 minutes already

899
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:51,833
That's about the length of a whole movie

900
01:13:54,958 --> 01:13:56,083
Sit

901
01:13:57,875 --> 01:13:58,875
Sit

902
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,542
Then I will continue to compliment on

903
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,625
our undercover heroine

904
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,583
Boss

905
01:14:08,583 --> 01:14:09,458
I think...

906
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:12,458
you can write down all
your praises of me in a letter

907
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:13,750
That way, my mom can read it too

908
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,583
Then I will start with something
your mom shouldn't read about

909
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:18,625
At such a young age,

910
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,875
how is it possible that
you have such a great body?

911
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:26,583
Now praise me

912
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:31,708
Praise you

913
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:37,375
Just now he was making fun of your age

914
01:14:37,708 --> 01:14:38,792
It's okay

915
01:14:38,917 --> 01:14:40,083
I am old

916
01:14:40,083 --> 01:14:41,458
Let go of me

917
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,542
Let go of me

918
01:14:42,542 --> 01:14:43,667
What do you people want?

919
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:46,042
You are still so young,
you just have to work hard

920
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:47,500
Sooner or later you will get to higher places

921
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:49,083
I will. I will work hard

922
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:51,750
With a good boss like you,
I will bend backwards for the job

923
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:52,917
They took my mom

924
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:01,833
Why don't you go after him?

925
01:15:01,833 --> 01:15:02,833
I'm off

926
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:07,750
As courtesy, I should also chase
after them, right?

927
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:08,750
Of course

928
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,542
Don't run

929
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:13,250
Tell him about the supermarket coupon

930
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,708
What is it?

931
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,625
They are not valid on public holidays

932
01:15:58,417 --> 01:15:59,958
Good. You've got guts

933
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:02,000
You dare to come here

934
01:16:02,958 --> 01:16:05,208
I got the stuff with me. I want to see my mom

935
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,292
You are in no position to make any deals

936
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:09,583
I can kill you both

937
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:11,042
And the stuff will naturally become mine

938
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,000
The thermal box that he is holding
has a special device

939
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:16,792
He only has to press a button,

940
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:19,750
the Seed of God will be burned instantly
along with the doctor's memory drive

941
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,042
So you'd rather destroy it than
letting anyone get his hands on it

942
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:24,583
I think I had better allow you to see your mom

943
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:26,250
Take her out here

944
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,125
Mom

945
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:33,167
Did you sleep well in here?

946
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:34,750
Did you eat well?

947
01:16:35,292 --> 01:16:37,542
Oh, who would have guessed in
a crappy place like this,

948
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:39,875
there is actually a toilet

949
01:16:40,542 --> 01:16:42,375
You untie my mom first,

950
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,042
then I will give you the Seed of God

951
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,292
This is my turf. I make the rules

952
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:50,292
Give me the seeds

953
01:16:51,833 --> 01:16:53,625
Or would you like to witness how Iron Hawk...

954
01:16:53,625 --> 01:16:55,583
break your mother's legs?

955
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,958
Get lost

956
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I just need to press my watch

957
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,375
Sir Condor will instantly become a dead condor

958
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:35,375
Hurry up, let go of my mom

959
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:43,125
Sir Condor?

960
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:44,167
He is never Sir Condor

961
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:47,542
You are welcome to kill him

962
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:51,417
Me

963
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,000
Have always been me

964
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,542
He is the brother of Iron Hawk
- his name is Iron Tiger

965
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:56,750
He is my bodyguard

966
01:17:57,417 --> 01:18:00,542
I purposely make people think he is Sir Condor

967
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:02,625
So who do you think I am?

968
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:05,292
His sweet little mistress?

969
01:18:11,708 --> 01:18:13,542
What is this? Party time?

970
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:15,292
Let Iron Tiger go

971
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:18,000
Or I will put a bullet in your mom's underarm

972
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:19,500
Don't worry

973
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:22,292
She won't die, but there will be a lot of blood

974
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:23,292
and it will be painful

975
01:18:23,417 --> 01:18:24,583
No

976
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,583
Give me the seeds

977
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:55,958
Let me see if they are the real stuff

978
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:07,458
Water

979
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,542
This is really good stuff

980
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:49,500
When you get back, put 5 billion Euro into
a designated account of mine

981
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,708
Then I will release your mom

982
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,042
How can you not keep your promise?

983
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,375
I'm a woman, not a gentleman

984
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:57,042
How can you expect me to keep a promise?

985
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,750
Stand by

986
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:19,458
I'm ready

987
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:20,625
Get out of here!

988
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:22,542
I want to speak with my mom

989
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I can hear you

990
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:26,500
Yes, but we have to tie up your hands

991
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:29,000
Go ahead

992
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:44,542
What are you doing?

993
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:52,875
Son

994
01:20:58,708 --> 01:20:59,958
That's enough

995
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:03,583
Mom

996
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:07,833
There is something I've been wanting
to tell you for a long time

997
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:09,208
Go ahead

998
01:21:10,125 --> 01:21:11,125
In fact

999
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:13,792
I have already mastered the skill of...

1000
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,625
Breaking Free

1001
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,417
That is awesome

1002
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,375
Get her out of here

1003
01:22:27,167 --> 01:22:28,083
Quickly

1004
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:30,083
Let's go

1005
01:23:13,167 --> 01:23:14,500
Let's go get mom

1006
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:44,000
We can still use this old hag. Lock her up

1007
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:08,375
Get in quick

1008
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,292
Hey

1009
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,750
You're out-numbered. You can't beat the 3 of us

1010
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:26,250
Don't wait for me, I can handle it

1011
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:28,625
You're out-numbered. You can't beat the 2 of us

1012
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:35,500
Be careful, Louis

1013
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:37,667
This chick is not to be belittled

1014
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:18,875
You think you two are good enough to beat me?

1015
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:21,375
Don't forget I'm still here

1016
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:24,000
Oh, I have forgotten there is another one

1017
01:26:41,333 --> 01:26:43,500
You're out-numbered...

1018
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,500
You're out-numbered...

1019
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,708
You're out-numbered...

1020
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:50,083
You're out-numbered...

1021
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,292
You can't beat the <i>3</i> of us together

1022
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,208

1023
1022
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:12,625
Golden shield and iron clothes?

1024
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:14,208
She is a tip top kung fu master

1025
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:21,583
Old lady, I'm growing to like you more and more

1026
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,458
Iron clothes?

1027
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:27,917
Try my kicks

1028
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:44,000
Why?

1029
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,125
She is so afraid for her breasts

1030
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,542
They could be fake?

1031
01:27:55,792 --> 01:27:56,625
Keep attacking

1032
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:58,417
They're real

1033
01:28:21,417 --> 01:28:22,792
Phoenix, feed her the bug

1034
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,542
Mangoes

1035
01:28:55,042 --> 01:28:57,000
All this fighting...

1036
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,833
for the sake of some mangoes

1037
01:29:51,708 --> 01:29:53,083
Mom, put this on

1038
01:29:56,125 --> 01:29:57,417
Put this on

1039
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:00,167
Quick

1040
01:30:03,167 --> 01:30:03,833
Mom

1041
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:05,500
Mom

1042
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:06,625
Leave now

1043
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,375
- My hat
- You go first

1044
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:19,292
"Parachute"

1045
01:30:21,042 --> 01:30:21,792
Louis

1046
01:30:23,333 --> 01:30:23,917
Grab this

1047
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:31,042
You go first

1048
01:30:39,583 --> 01:30:41,083
There's no time

1049
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:42,833
You go first

1050
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:44,250
Go

1051
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:12,208
Hello

1052
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:13,375
Hello

1053
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:14,875
Hello?

1054
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:16,167
Who is this?

1055
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:21,750
It's Sampan. That's right

1056
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,833
- What's up?
- Nothing

1057
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,750
It's my day off. Thought I should
give you a call

1058
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,750
Where are you?

1059
01:32:31,292 --> 01:32:33,083
I'm on a plane

1060
01:32:33,833 --> 01:32:35,125
Any problems?

1061
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:36,250
No

1062
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:40,625
Okay, I have to go

1063
01:32:40,792 --> 01:32:42,375
The plane is about to taking off

1064
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,375
Okay then

1065
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,500
Bye

1066
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,417
Hey...

1067
01:32:46,792 --> 01:32:47,750
Hello

1068
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:51,208
About your job,

1069
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:52,625
I do understand

1070
01:32:53,917 --> 01:32:55,542
But if there are any dangerous missions,

1071
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:57,583
try to get out of it

1072
01:32:57,833 --> 01:32:58,958
You have to stay alive...

1073
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:00,833
so as to save the world

1074
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,708
Stop nagging

1075
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,417
I have to go

1076
01:33:08,208 --> 01:33:11,417
I will call you again when I have the chance

1077
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:13,792
Bye

1078
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:29,333
"Ejection Button"

1079
01:33:52,125 --> 01:33:54,417
I called my wife!

1080
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:09,708
- Happy birthday
- Thank you

1081
01:34:09,708 --> 01:34:11,042
Thank you

1082
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:12,292
It's you

1083
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:13,792
This is awesome

1084
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:16,167
Mom

1085
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,125
This is Mr KK, he is Sir Sampan's boss

1086
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:22,000
Your Dad's boss?

1087
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,500
Mrs Luo, you are very pretty

1088
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,500
Thank you for saving the world

1089
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:28,667
Don't mention it

1090
01:34:28,667 --> 01:34:30,625
I have to thank you on behalf
of the whole world

1091
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:31,792
You have such a great son

1092
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,625
I must pay you a long compliment

1093
01:34:36,083 --> 01:34:37,625
I'm happy with your performance this time

1094
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:39,792
You can take me to a movie tonight

1095
01:34:39,958 --> 01:34:41,042
Too late

1096
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:42,542
I belong to someone already

1097
01:34:42,917 --> 01:34:43,750
Who is that?

1098
01:34:48,917 --> 01:34:49,833
Baby

1099
01:34:50,583 --> 01:34:53,292
I think she is more suitable for me

1100
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:55,542
How old are you?

1101
01:34:59,042 --> 01:35:00,292

1102
1101
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:02,625
28?

1103
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:04,458
You don't look it at all

1104
01:35:05,208 --> 01:35:08,375
You are looking too good for a 28 year old

1105
01:35:08,375 --> 01:35:09,125
Sir Sampan

1106
01:35:09,125 --> 01:35:10,458
Do you drink soup every day?

1107
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:12,833
Why is his picture here?

1108
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:14,458
This used to be the picture of my dad

1109
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:16,417
It's still the picture of your dad

1110
01:35:17,875 --> 01:35:19,625
Looks like I'll have another dad soon

1111
01:35:20,917 --> 01:35:21,917
Sir Sampan

1112
01:35:22,333 --> 01:35:23,167
Are you alright?

1113
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:25,875
I am okay

1114
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:26,792
How are you feeling?

1115
01:35:26,792 --> 01:35:27,875
Take me outside

1116
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:28,833
<i>Okay</i>

1117
01:35:29,333 --> 01:35:31,292
Louis, who are you waiting for

1118
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:34,167
Phoenix said she'd come

1119
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,292
Look, she's here

1120
01:35:41,042 --> 01:35:42,708
Sorry I'm late

1121
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:43,750
Happy Birthday

1122
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:44,958
Thank you

1123
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:48,833
You guys chat

1124
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:52,875
How do you do? I'm Louis Luo

1125
01:35:54,583 --> 01:35:56,083
Ignore him

1126
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,833
He is a con man that I just caught

1127
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:01,458
Thought I should just come here with him

1128
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:02,667
instead of dropping him off
at the police station

1129
01:36:03,458 --> 01:36:05,167
I thought...

1130
01:36:05,458 --> 01:36:06,458
he was your boyfriend

1131
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:08,250
You think I have such bad taste?

1132
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,125
Hey, that's a personal attack

1133
01:36:10,125 --> 01:36:11,667
You think good looking guys can”: be cons?

1134
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:14,583
Beware of good looking guys

1135
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:16,583
Shall we have dinner tonight?

1136
01:36:16,667 --> 01:36:19,208
I just got my new mission. I'm going to Brazil

1137
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:20,250
I'll see you when I get back

1138
01:36:21,583 --> 01:36:22,333
Okay

1139
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:25,625
Bye

1140
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:33,708
Hey

1141
01:36:34,042 --> 01:36:36,167
Have my plane ready,
I'm flying to Brazil tonight

1142
01:36:48,792 --> 01:36:51,000
Why is Sir Sampan's picture hanging here?

1143
01:36:53,333 --> 01:36:55,167
Are you jealous?

1144
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:59,167
I can put yours on the wall tomorrow, okay?

1145
01:36:59,708 --> 01:37:01,042
Oh, that's not necessary

1146
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:04,250
Just change this one to black-and-white

1147
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:15,167
Happy Birthday to you...

1148
01:37:16,417 --> 01:37:18,292
Now the Luos and myself
are the only people that...

1149
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,333
knows about the existence of the Seed of God

1150
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:23,750
We haven't made the world a better place

1151
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:27,375
But then at least we haven't made it worse

1152
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,500
Sampan Hung

1153
01:37:39,208 --> 01:37:41,167
Why don't you turn around?

1154
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,583
No

1155
01:37:42,958 --> 01:37:45,458
I am afraid I would lose you when I turn around

1156
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:49,000
I heard you have really saved the world

1157
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:51,083
And you made time to call me before
you thought you were dying

1158
01:37:52,125 --> 01:37:53,042
You're getting taller

1159
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:54,542
Stop it

1160
01:37:58,625 --> 01:37:59,667
Let's take a selfie

1161
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:03,125
This way...

1162
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,917
Take one holding each other

1163
01:38:08,917 --> 01:38:11,250
Okay. Let me hold you

1167
01:38:12,305 --> 01:39:12,263
